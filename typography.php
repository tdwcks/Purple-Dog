					<p>The first duty of government is to protect economic and national security, thereby allowing the government to extend opportunity for working people at every stage of their lives. The Spending Review and Autumn Statement delivers on that priority. It sets out a long term economic plan to fix the public finances, return the country to surplus and run a healthy economy that starts to pay down its debt. Debt is projected to fall in every year of this Parliament as a share of GDP and the surplus is forecast to reach £10 billion by 2019-20.</p>
